# EVENT 
- the initial / starting points
- 


## STATE // HANDLER
- make the changes 
- updates the changes 
- in this case 'add' the new cat's into the object array ==> data comes from the 'form' at event state



## RENDER 
- showcase / display the changes that the handler generates 

## TIPS:
- how to remove an actual array from the DOM * specific array/object: use the .index() method

- if you have the element you can remove it by index

- have your state be up to speed with your DOM
